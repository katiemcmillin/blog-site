## Project Description

My project will be a Reddit-like social media site with the ability to interact with posts, upvoting them and being able to see the highest scored posts.

If I have time during the week, I would like to add the functionality of users being able to edit and delete posts. Also, I would like to add the ability to embed video and images Post-MVP.

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations. Here's an example.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|May 5-7| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Complete
|May 7| Project Approval | Complete
|May 7| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Complete
|May 7-12| Pseudocode / actual code | Complete
|May 12| Initial Clickable Model  | Complete
|May 12| MVP | Complete
|May 14| Presentations | Incomplete

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

# Project Overview

## Project Name

Post-it

## Project Description

My project will be a Reddit-like social media site with the ability to interact with posts, upvoting them and being able to see the highest scored posts.

If I have time during the week, I would like to add the functionality of users being able to edit and delete posts. Also, I would like to add the ability to embed video and images Post-MVP.

## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "recBIdKDbwXrUsyYk",
            "fields": {
                "title": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.",
                "body": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc aliquam eleifend tristique. Sed congue fringilla nisi at varius. In lacus nunc, sodales ...",
                "author": "Imcool56"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-05-07T10:09:46.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recEtt350WMNfotlJ",
            "fields": {
                "title": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.",
                "body": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc aliquam eleifend tristique. Sed congue fringilla nisi at varius. In lacus nunc, sodales ...",
                "author": "Imcooler55"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-05-07T10:09:46.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recnlaKF5KAnpiSfl",
            "fields": {
                "title": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.",
                "body": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc aliquam eleifend tristique. Sed congue fringilla nisi at varius. In lacus nunc, sodales ...",
                "author": "Imthecoolest54"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-05-07T10:09:46.000Z"
        }
    ],
    "offset": "recnlaKF5KAnpiSfl"
}
```

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Users can add their own posts
- Users can upvote posts
- Users can add comments to posts
- The posts with the most votes will be calculated 

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*


- Users can delete posts
- Users can edit posts
- Users can format text
- Users can add video
- Users can add images

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations. Here's an example.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|May 5-7| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|May 7| Project Approval | Incomplete
|May 7| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|May 7-12| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|May 12| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|May 12| MVP | Incomplete
|May 14| Presentations | Incomplete

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: Good at outside research, have a good grasp of my skillset and what I'm going to be able to accomplish

### Weaknesses: Sometimes I stay stuck on problems too long before asking for help.

### Opportunities: Advanced CSS

### Threats: Self-doubt
